# QKD-Message

During the 2023-2024 Quantum Computing Course, a **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** protocol program was developed using Python. The program simulates a secure messaging system, like iMessages or WhatsApp, that encrypts messages using QKD algorithms. The encryption process involves converting the message to binary, then hashing it using the numpy, hash, and Qiskit libraries. If an interception is detected, the decrypted plaintext will differ from the original message, indicating a breach in security.

# How Does This Work? 
Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), which allows for plaintext to be converted via the hash and numpy libraries used in my code. 

# How do I use your code?
Once uploading my code, go into the program console in your respective IDE.
From There, input your name, sender's name, and message. Then an output should appear with your respective message encoded, the hash key, and decrypted message.

## Created During QxQ Introduction to Quantum Computing 2023 - 2024.
